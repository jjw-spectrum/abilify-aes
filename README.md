# Finding adverse events with the FAERS API
### By: Jaclyn Jeffrey-Wilensky (jaclyn@spectrumnews.org)


This GitHub repo contains the Jupyter Notebook I used to find adverse events in autistic children prescribed aripiprazole for the Spectrum story [Hed TK](https://www.spectrumnews.org). In this document, I'll describe how you can use this notebook for your own purposes. I'll also lay out the steps I took to go from the raw FAERS data to the visualization that you see in the story.

These steps are written for beginners like me; if you're a more advanced user, you can skip straight to [Adapting the notebook](https://github.com/jjw-spectrum/abilify-aes/blob/master/README.md#adapting-the-notebook).
